# CloseViewMode

This unofficial TaleSpire plugin that allows:
Change the in-game camera to "third/first-person mode"
GM to force the camera in "third/first-person mode" on all players

This plugin should prevent other players from seeing locations on the map that their characters shouldn't be able to see.
